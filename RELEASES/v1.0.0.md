# v1.0.0 – Initial public release

This release delivers the first public version of the Aptos (Apartment Rental System), including a React SPA (Vite + Tailwind), Django REST API + Admin, Dockerized deployments, production‑ready Nginx proxy, and a blue‑green deployment strategy.

## Highlights
- Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind) with apartment and builder listings, filters, gallery, and responsive UI.
- Backend (Django 5.2 + DRF) with paginated APIs, health endpoint at `/api/v1/health/`, and Django Admin improvements.
- Nginx configuration for production: reverse proxy, static/media serving, security headers, gzip, rate limiting.
- Blue‑Green deployment with HAProxy (`docker-compose.blue-green.yml`, `haproxy/haproxy.cfg`) and scripts:
  - `scripts/deploy.sh` – builds, health‑checks target env, switches LB, rollback on failure.
  - `scripts/post-deploy-validation.sh` – smoke tests for UI and APIs.
- Validation toolkit and tests:
  - Lighthouse/axe/Playwright based validation runner (`validation-runner.js`).
  - Django unit/API tests, Vitest for React, basic E2E (Playwright).
  - GitHub Actions CI for backend and frontend tests.
- Documentation: architecture, runbooks, go‑live plan, admin guide, monitoring, pre‑prod checklist, disaster recovery, training materials.

## Getting Started
- Dev stack: `make up` (Frontend at http://localhost:3000, API at http://localhost:8000/api/v1)
- Production‑like (Nginx): `make up-prod`
- Blue‑Green deploy: `make bg-deploy` then `make bg-validate`

## Notes
- Ensure `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set appropriately (dev: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).
- See `docs/` for detailed ops procedures and go‑live guidance.
